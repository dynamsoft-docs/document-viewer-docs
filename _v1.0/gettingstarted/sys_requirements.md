# System Requirements

The SDK requires the following features to work:

- `WebAssembly`, `Blob`, `URL`/`createObjectURL`, `Web Workers`

  The above four features are required for the SDK to work.

## Supported Browsers

The following table is a list of supported browsers based on the above requirements:

  | Browser Name |             Version              |
  | :----------: | :------------------------------: |
  |    Chrome    |             latest                 |
  |   Firefox    |             latest                  |
  |    Safari    |             latest                 |
  |     Edge     |             latest                 |

Apart from the browsers, the operating systems may impose some limitations of their own that could restrict the use of the SDKs.
