# Introduction to Dynamsoft Document Viewer

Dynamsoft Document Viewer is a browser-based JavaScript SDK designed for viewing and editing images and PDFs. It provides a wide range of functionalities, including PDF annotation, page manipulation, image quality enhancement, and document saving.

## Security

Dynamsoft Document Viewer does not rely on any external third-party JavaScript library. All processing, such as rendering and editing, is securely performed within the browser. This architecture eliminates the need for a server-side backend, ensuring security compliance and scalability.

## Browser and Platform Compatibility

Dynamsoft Document Viewer is designed to work seamlessly across different browsers and platforms. It is compatible with major browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge, ensuring a consistent user experience. Additionally, it supports various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, and Android, allowing users to access documents from any device.

## Supported File Types

Users can open, edit, and save PDFs, as well as images in various formats, such as JPEG, PNG, and TIFF.

## Annotation Types

Dynamsoft Document Viewer supports a variety of annotation types to enhance document interaction and collaboration. Users can add, edit, and delete annotations such as:

- text
- highlight
- underline
- strikeout
- shape
- stamp
- freehand drawing

## Data Management Concepts

Dynamsoft Document Viewer organizes data using two main concepts: "document" and "page." A document can contain one or multiple pages, and each page must belong to a single document.

- Page: The smallest unit of data management. Each page has a unique page ID.
- Document: A collection of pages, each with a unique doc ID. Documents collectively make up the entire data set.

Managing data, therefore, involves managing documents and pages.

- [Document Management]({{ site.features }}datamanagement/docmanagement.html)
- [Page Management]({{ site.features }}datamanagement/pagemanagement.html)

If you are using the default UI of DDV, data processing and management are handled internally.

## UI Customization

The SDK offers extensive customization options, enabling developers to tailor the UI to meet specific application needs and branding requirements.

## Designed to Support Diverse Document Workflows

Dynamsoft Document Viewer is built to support a wide range of document-centric workflows with its document viewing, editing, and scanning features. It has four built-in viewer types to suit different use cases:

* **Edit Viewer**: Enables viewing and editing of documents with annotation support.
* **Capture Viewer**: Integrates camera controls for streamlined, continuous capture workflows.
* **Perspective Viewer**: Allows document cropping with perspective transformation.
* **Browse Viewer**: Suitable for previewing multi-page documents or navigating document collections.
