# Capture Viewer

Capture Viewer is used to control camera, play video stream, and capture the images from camera.

- [Default user interface]({{ site.ui }}default_elements.html#capture-viewer)
- [Default viewer configuration]({{ site.viewer }}viewerconfig.html#capture-viewer)

```typescript
const captureViewer = new Dynamsoft.DDV.CaptureViewer({
    container: document.getElementById("viewer")
});
captureViewer.openDocument("docUid"); // Open a document which has pages
```

## Control camera

### Select camera

DDV's built-in Camera Viewer will select the best camera device in the camera list as the default camera. The method [`selectCamera()`]({{ site.api }}class/captureviewer.html#selectcamera) can help to select the camera you would like to use.

- Select the first camera in the camera list
    ```typescript
    const cameras = await captureViewer.getAllCameras();
    if (cameras.length) {
        await captureViewer.selectCamera(cameras[0]);
    }
    ```

- Select the camera whose label is "Dynamsoft camera".

    ```typescript
    const cameras = await captureViewer.getAllCameras();
    for (var i=0;i<cameras.length;i++)
    { 
        if(cameras[i].label == "Dynamsoft camera"){
            captureViewer.selectCamera(cameras[i]);
            break;
        }
    }
    ```

### Play/stop video stream

After selecting the specified camera, you need to call [`play()`]({{ site.api }}class/captureviewer.html#play) to play the video stream.

```typescript
await captureViewer.play();
```

If you want to stop the video stream, please call [`stop()`]({{ site.api }}class/captureviewer.html#stop) method.

```typescript
captureViewer.stop();
```

### Set resolution

The resolution of camera can be set when playing the video stream.

```typescript
// Set to 1080P
await captureViewer.play({
	 resolution: [1920,1080], 
});
```

### Turn on flashlight

After playing the video stream, the flashlight can be opened by using [`turnOnTorch()`]({{ site.api }}class/captureviewer.html#turnontorch).

```typescript
// Turn on flashlight
await captureViewer.turnOnTorch();

// Turn off flashlight
await captureViewer.turnOffTorch();
```

> Note that it only works with Chromium-based browsers such as Edge and Chrome on Windows or Android. Other browsers such as Firefox or Safari are not supported. 

> Note that all browsers on iOS (including Chrome) use WebKit as the rendering engine and are not supported.

## Capture

### Real-time boundaries detection

After configuring [Document Detection]({{ site.features }}advanced/documentdetect.html), if you set [`enableAutoDetect`]({{ site.api }}class/captureviewer.html#enableautodetect) to `true`, real-time border detection in video stream will be enabled.

```typescript
captureViewer.enableAutoDetect = true;
```

### Auto capture

When [`enableAutoCapture`]({{ site.api }}class/captureviewer.html#enableautocapture) is set to `true`, the capture viewer will capture frame automatically.

```typescript
captureViewer.enableAutoCapture = true;
```

> If the auto detect is disabled, it will automatically capture a frame every 1 second by default. It can be set by [autoCaptureDelay]({{ site.api }}interface/captureviewerconfig.html#autocapturedelay).

> If the auto detect is enabled, automatic capturing will only be performed when the detection result meets expectations.
