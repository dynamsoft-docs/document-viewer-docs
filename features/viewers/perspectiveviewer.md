# Perspective Viewer

Perspective Viewer is used to do page boundaries manual adjustment & perspective transformation. The page data displayed on this viewer is its original data.

- [Default user interface]({{ site.ui }}default_ui.html#perspective-viewer)
- [Default viewer configuration]({{ site.viewer }}viewerconfig.html#perspective-viewer)

```typescript
const perspectiveViewer = new Dynamsoft.DDV.PerspectiveViewer({
    container: document.getElementById("viewer"),
});

perspectiveViewer.openDocument("docUid"); // Open a document which has pages
```

## Quadrilateral selection

Quadrilateral Selection in the perspective viewer means the selection which will be perspective transformed.

In addition to drawing and adjusting the selection through the UI, DDV also provides some additional interfaces to operate the selection.

- Set a quadrilateral selection on the current page by using [`setQuadSelection()`]({{ site.api }}class/perspectiveviewer.html#setquadselection). If the selection is exceeds the bounds of the current page, it won't take effect.

    ```typescript
    const quad = [
        [314,518],
        [2200,625],
        [2204,3339],
        [176,3048]
    ];

    perspectiveViewer.setQuadSelection(quad);
    ```

- Get the quadrilateral selection on the current page by using [`getQuadSelection()`]({{ site.api }}class/perspectiveviewer.html#getquadselection).

    ```typescript
    const quad = perspectiveViewer.getQuadSelection();
    ```

- Reset the quadrilateral selection to the original one by using [`resetQuadSelection()`]({{ site.api }}class/perspectiveviewer.html#resetquadselection). The original selection on the page can be detected by [Document Detect]({{ site.features }}advanced/documentdetect.html) during capturing in the capture viewer or set by [`ExtraPageData`]({{ site.api }}interface/idocument/extrapagedata.html) in [`loadSource()`]({{ site.api }}interface/idocument/index.html#loadsource) when loading the page. If it is not detected or set before, the original selection would be the whole page range.

    ```typescript
    perspectiveViewer.resetQuadSelection();
    ```

## Perspective transformation

Perspective transformation in the perspective viewer is to rectify the quadrilateral selection. It is implemented by the method [`applyPerspective()`]({{ site.api }}class/perspectiveviewer.html#applyperspective).

```typescript
const quad = perspectiveViewer.getQuadSelection();
await perspectiveViewer.applyPerspective(quad);
```
